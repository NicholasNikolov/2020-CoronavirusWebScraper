# 2020-CoronavirusWebScraper
 I attempted to create a Covid-19 webscraper but unfortunately the site was too unexpectedly dynamic, releasing new changes to the table I was pulling from on a frequent basis. The latest April 09 update has made my code completely unusable. I will likely still explore a solution for practice, but sadly a lot of data collection will be lost.
